      <p>I am Melanie Mok. Welcome to my portfolio. I am
      currently working toward becoming a full-stack software developer, 
      and this is my first official self-developed web page. I am very 
      passionate with coding. At one point, I did not realize that I was 
      coding for thirteen hours straight, I was not even feeling tired, and that
      was the very beginning of my intoduction to Computer Sceince 
      courses. </p>
      
      <p>Right now, I am looking forward to be creating my first 
      fully functional game that I have had in my mind for years. I want 
      to be able to make my very own game from scratch, taking care of 
      both front-end and back-end of the entire game. I really wanted to
      create games, mainly because I think games can express my thoughts,
      my cultures and personality. It can also bring joy while being 
      educational depend on the categories of the game. I look forward 
      to everything that I will be learning in this class.</p>
